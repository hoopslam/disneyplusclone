# Disney Plus Clone

This is a clone project to replicate the Front End of Disney Plus. The project was built using React, Styled-Components, Firebase, and Redux Toolkit. A tutorial project by the Clever Programmer on Youtube, this project was one of my first React projects and helped me to understand how Redux and Firebase fits with React and Styled-Components.
